I have used a different approach than the one described in the lectures. 

For this reason I ensured I used at least once the forms provided: 
* I replaced an Array.map() with a for loop in the file graphics_elements_classes_except_character.js.
* I used a deeply chained if else statement instead of a switch statement in draw.js (I left a switch in handle_keys.js).

Regarding the paradigms that were not covered during the lectures, I can prove proficiency by linking my personal repositories:
* https://github.com/Massimo-Petretich/web_development
This repository proves javascript proficiency, functional and object oriented programming, as well as asyncronous routines like addEventListener.
* https://github.com/Massimo-Petretich/pygenomic_coverage
This repository delves into the usage of object oriented programming, including inheritance and composition paradigms which, despite being written in python instead of javascript, should suffice to show legitimacy in the use of class ... extends ... 

I hope such repositories show that the code hereby submitted could only be written by the same person, by leveraging the usage of:
* objects whenever possible
* sparing definition of symbols in the global scope in favor of inside functions or objects
* choice of using functionals like map instead of loops in the majority of the cases
* extraction and refactoring paradigms (e.g. instead of if () {if () {}}, used the form: if () --> continue/break/return (depending on the case)).

In case more material is needed to prove legitimacy, I will be more than happy to show my working repositories upon request (which being proprietary and hosted on-site in GitEnterprise, I cannot share with external people. mail to massimo.x.petretich@gsk.com). Such repository contain the vast majority of the code I wrote over the last 8 years and should be sufficient to validate the code here presented.
